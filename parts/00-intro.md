# W2D3 â€“ Networking with TCP (and HTTP)

Today, we're going to learn the basics of how computers
communicate, that is, send data between each other. We're
going to learn about networking protocols, in particular
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet
Protocol) and how they work together. We're going to do an
activity to demonstrate the design of TCP/IP, then see how
this translates into a simple server and client in Node.

If time allows, we'll also briefly discuss HTTP (HyperText
Transfer Protocol).
