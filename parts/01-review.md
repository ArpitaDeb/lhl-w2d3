## Review

### Asynchronous JS

- there's some operations that run more-or-less linear, others have to wait
  (those ones that wait are async)
    - for ex: setTimeout (based on timing, has to wait before it runs)

- not synchronous JS

    - JS executes one task at a time
    - synchronous JS exectues in order

- setTimeout â€“ this code runs later, after a specific
  amount of time has passed
- `readFile`, and other I/O operations

- Async code is code that does not execute immediately,
  but at some specified later time or when a particular
  event is triggered.

### Events in JS

- could be: an input from a user, (lots of events in the
  browser), stdin `data`

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the
  system you are programming, which the system tells you
  about so you can respond to them as needed.

- The system will give a signal when an event occurs, so
  that the appropriate response (that is, a callback
  function) is taken.

- An __Event Handler__ is a callback function that will be
  called when an event is triggered.

    - `.on('someEvent', function() { ... })`

### The event loop
