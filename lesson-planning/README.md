# W2D3 - Networking with TCP (and HTTP)

In this lesson, we're going to learn the basics of how computers communicate,
that is, send data between each other. We're going to learn about networking
protocols, in particular TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet
Protocol) and how they work together. We're going to do an activity to
demonstrate the design of TCP/IP, then see how this translates into a simple
server and client in Node.

If time allows, we'll also briefly discuss HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

## Learning goalso

### For students

1. Define: TCP, IP, port, packets, packet headers, packet body, bandwidth,
   protocol, connection.
2. Identify the difference between software and hardware in TCP/IP Node servers
   and clients.
3. Explain why networking protocols are necessary and useful for transferring
   data between networked machines.
4. List and describe simplified steps in sending and receiving a message over TCP.
5. Trace a simple server and client written in Node using the `net` package.
6. (Bonus) Define: HTTP, URL, method (GET), request and response, headers, body,
   status code.
7. (Bonus) List and describe common HTTP status codes.
8. (Bonus) List and describe simplified steps in sending and receiving HTTP
   messages.
9. (Bonus) Relate HTTP and TCP.

### For Hora»õiu

1. Identify how students are using lecture notes.

## Prerequisites

1. Students can define, describe and implement JavaScript code using first order
   functions, in particular callbacks.
2. Students can define and describe asynchronous programming in JavaScript, in
   particular:
    - why is asynchronous code necessary?
    - what are some examples of asynchronous JavaScript?
    - what is an event?
    - what is the event loop?
3. Students can implement simple JavaScript exercises involving terminal input
   and output with `stdin` and `stdout`.
